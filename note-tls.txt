That error you're seeing:

vbnet

Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
...is related to Node.js v17+ using OpenSSL 3, which changes how cryptographic algorithms are handledâ€”causing compatibility issues with some npm packages or Webpack-based projects.

âœ… Solutions
ðŸ›  Option 1: Set Legacy OpenSSL Env Variable (Quick Fix)
Run this before your npm start, npm install, or other commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
If you're on Windows CMD:

cmd
Copy
Edit
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
On PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
To make it permanent, add it to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or shell config file:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo 'export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
ðŸ›  Option 2: Downgrade Node to LTS v16
Most packages are still best supported on Node.js 16.

You can downgrade using [nvm (Node Version Manager)]:

bash
Copy
Edit
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
Check version:

bash
Copy
Edit
node -v
ðŸ›  Option 3: Upgrade Your Package (if available)
Some packages (especially Webpack) released patches to support OpenSSL 3. You can try:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm update
And ensure your webpack or related packages are up to date in package.json.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Happens
Node 17+ switched to OpenSSL 3, which disables some older crypto algorithms used by older dependencies (especially Webpack 4 or less). Unless your dependencies are updated to support the new OpenSSL API, you'll hit this error.
